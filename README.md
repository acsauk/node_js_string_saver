User stories - MVP

As a user with something to say,
so I can access a copy of my notes from anywhere,
I would like to be able to save a string online

As a user with a bad memory,
so I can look at my notes whenever I need them,
I would like to be able to retrieve my saved strings

As a security conscious user,
so I can ensure no one else can access my notes
I would like to use a unique identifier to access my saved strings
